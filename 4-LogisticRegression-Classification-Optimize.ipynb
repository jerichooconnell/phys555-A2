    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is a sample dataset from sklearn and comes shipped with the package. It is a binary classification of whether a biopsied breast mass contains cancer or not provided by the University of Wisconsin A short description is found in the sklearn documentation https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#breast-cancer-dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The description is copied in the cell below so that you do not need to visit the above link.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is useful to me in particular as my PhD work is in medical imaging and some of the work I do is diagnostic imaging for breast cancer screening. This dataset is a classic machine learning dataset that deals with the classification of breast cancer biopsies to see if breast masses are malignant or not using features from a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass. This would be the next step in cancer diagnosis following a positive result in a diagnostic image from a mammography machine which is an imaging tests that my research is involved with. To see the bigger picture in the cancer diagnosis process in our clinic I am very interested in this process, that is why I chose this specific dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this dataset would be to train a model that is able to use the features to classify a new sample as is benign or malignant with high accuracy.\n",
